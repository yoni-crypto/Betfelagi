# House Data Import Guide

## 🏠 Save Money & Improve Performance

I've created a system to fetch houses from the external API once, save them to your database, and then load from your own DB. This saves money on API costs and makes your app faster!

## 📋 What's Changed

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
- Added `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `area` fields
- Added `isExternalListing` flag to identify external data
- Added `externalId` for tracking external properties
- Added `lastUpdated` timestamp

### **2. Import Script**
- `backend/scripts/fetchAndSaveHouses.js` - Fetches and saves external data
- Handles data transformation and duplicate prevention
- One-time setup to populate your database

### **3. Frontend Updates**
- Removed external API calls
- Now loads all data from your database
- Faster loading times
- No more API rate limits

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Your Database Schema
The House model has been updated with new fields. If you have existing data, you may need to migrate it.

### Step 2: Get a Real User ID
Before running the import script, you need a real user ID from your database:

1. Go to your MongoDB database
2. Find a user in the `users` collection
3. Copy their `_id` field
4. Update the script: `backend/scripts/fetchAndSaveHouses.js`
5. Replace `'65f1234567890abcdef12345'` with the real user ID

### Step 3: Run the Import Script
```bash
cd backend
npm run import-houses
```

This will:
- Connect to your database
- Fetch 100 houses from the external API
- Transform the data to match your schema
- Save them to your database
- Mark them as external listings

### Step 4: Test Your App
Your app will now load houses from your database instead of making external API calls!

## 💰 Cost Savings

### **Before (External API calls)**
- 100 requests/month = $X (depends on your plan)
- Slower loading times
- Rate limiting issues

### **After (Database storage)**
- 1 request to import data = $0.XX
- Instant loading from database
- No rate limits
- Full control over data

## 🔄 Updating Data

To refresh the external house data:

1. Run the import script again: `npm run import-houses`
2. It will delete old external listings and add new ones
3. Your app will automatically show the updated data

## 📊 What You Get

- **100+ Houses**: Real property data with actual details
- **Complete Information**: Bedrooms, bathrooms, area, images
- **Fast Loading**: No external API delays
- **Cost Effective**: One-time import vs. per-request costs
- **Full Control**: Data stored in your database

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Import Settings
Edit `backend/scripts/fetchAndSaveHouses.js`:

```javascript
DEFAULT_SEARCH: {
    limit: 200 // Increase to get more houses
}
```

### Add More Data Sources
You can modify the script to fetch from multiple APIs and combine the data.

### Schedule Regular Updates
Set up a cron job to run the import script weekly/monthly to keep data fresh.

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Cost Savings**: No more per-request API costs
2. **Performance**: Faster loading from local database
3. **Reliability**: No dependency on external API availability
4. **Control**: Full control over data and presentation
5. **Scalability**: Can handle more users without API limits

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **User ID Required**: Make sure to update the user ID in the script
- **Database Space**: External listings will take up database space
- **Data Freshness**: External data won't update automatically
- **Backup**: Consider backing up your database before running imports

## 🎉 Result

Your app now has:
- ✅ 100+ real houses from external API
- ✅ Fast loading from your database
- ✅ No more API costs
- ✅ Full control over data
- ✅ Better user experience

Run the import script once and enjoy the benefits! 🏠✨
